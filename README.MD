# Ryanet
Yet another personal website project for learning Java and other things.

## What I am using
- Spring Framework (without Spring Boot, with JavaConfig)
- Hibernate
- MariaDB

## What I am trying to do now
I am writing study notes with Markdown now so I am trying to make myself a little thingy to check my precious notes without my laptop

(Without an app on my phone obviously because I am a nerd)

## What is on my todo list
- A little dump bucket thingy to write all my whining words or something and dump them with amazing animations or what not.
- A private, also a public blog cause why not.
